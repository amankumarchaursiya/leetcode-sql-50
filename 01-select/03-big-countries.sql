-- 595. Big Countries
-- Problem Statement: find the name, population, and area of the big countries. A country is big if:
-- 1. it has an area of at least three million (i.e., 3000000 km2), or
-- 2. it has a population of at least twenty-five million (i.e., 25000000)
-- Return the result table in any order

-- Approach:
-- Select name, population, area from the World table
-- Keep only those rows where area >= 3 million or population >= 25 million

SELECT name, population, area
FROM World
WHERE (area >= 3000000) OR (population >= 25000000);
